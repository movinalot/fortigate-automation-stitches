# Azure Micro-Segmentation Using Azure Automation and FortiGate Automation Stitches

## Create an Azure RunBook and configure a FortiGate Automation Stitch

A FortiGate Automation Stitch brings together a trigger and an action. In this code the trigger is a log event and the action is the execution of a webhook.

* The trigger - a log event is generated when an IP address is added or removed from a dynamic address object
* The action - a webhook sends an HTTPS POST request to an endpoint in Azure. The endpoint runs a PowerShell script to update an Azure route table. The HTTP headers and JSON formatted body contain the information required to update the route table to manage micro-segmentation through the use of host routes. A host route is a route that indicates a specific host by using the IP-ADDRESS/32 in IPV4

This code covers the

* Setup of an Azure Automation Account
* Importing required Azure PowerShell Modules
* Creation and Publishing of Azure Runbook
* Creation of Webhook to invoke Azure Runbook
* Creation of FortiGate Dynamic Address
* Creation of FortiGate Automation Stitch
* Creation of FortiGate Automation Stitch Trigger
* Creation of FortiGate Automation Stitch Action

### Part 1. Azure

Automation in Azure can be accomplished in a number of ways, Logic Apps, Function Apps, Runbooks, etc. Each of the automation methods can be triggered in a number of ways, Events, Webhooks, Schedules, etc.

The Azure Cloudshell PowerShell commands create an Azure Automation account that enables the running of an Azure Runbook via a Webhook. An Azure Runbook is just a script, in this case PowerShell, that the Automation Account can run. The actions the Runbook can perform are controlled by the rights and scope (where those actions can be performed) that have been granted to the Automation Account.

The Actions are contained in PowerShell Modules that have been imported into the Automation Account. The PowerShell Modules are libraries of commands called Cmdlets that are grouped into several domains. For example, Accounts, Automation, Compute, Network, and Resources.

All of the steps can be performed in the Azure Portal. However, the commands shown in each section can be run directly in Azure Cloudshell. Cloudshell has all the required utilities to execute the commands. Nothing additional needs to be loaded on a personal device.

1. Azure Automation Account
    * Create Automation Account [Automation Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-create-standalone-account)

        1. Create a new Resource Group

        ```PowerShell
        New-AzResourceGroup -Name "resource-group-name" -Location azure-location
        ```

        1. Create an Automation Account in the new Resource Group
            * Choose a Location
            * Provide a Name
            * Choose the Basic Plan
            * Indicate the assignment of a System Assigned Identity </br></br>

        ```PowerShell
        New-AzAutomationAccount -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -Location eastus -Name user-automation-01 -AssignSystemIdentity -Plan Basic
        ```

    * Setup Automation Account [Managed Identity] (<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview>)

        ```PowerShell
        New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId (Get-AzAutomationAccount -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -Name user-automation-01).Identity.PrincipalId -RoleDefinitionName "Contributor" -Scope (Get-AzResourceGroup -Name "resource-group-name" -Location eastus).ResourceId
        ```

    * Import Az PowerShell Modules
        * Az.Accounts - This module needs to be imported first as the other modules have a dependency on it
        * Az.Automation
        * Az.Compute
        * Az.Network
        * Az.Resources

        ```PowerShell
        Import-AzAutomationModule -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -AutomationAccountName user-automation-01 -Name Az.Accounts  -ContentLinkUri https://www.powershellgallery.com/api/v2/package/Az.Accounts
        @("Automation","Compute","Network","Resources") | ForEach-Object {Import-AzAutomationModule -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -AutomationAccountName user-automation-01 -Name Az.$_  -ContentLinkUri https://www.powershellgallery.com/api/v2/package/Az.$_}
        ```

1. Azure Automation Runbook
    * Create, Import, and Publish Runbook

        ```PowerShell
        New-AzAutomationRunbook -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -AutomationAccountName user-automation-01 -Name ManageDynamicAddressRoutes -Type PowerShell
        
        Import-AzAutomationRunbook -Name ManageDynamicAddressRoutes -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -AutomationAccountName user-automation-01 -Path ./AzureMicroSeg/Azure/ManageDynamicAddressRoutes.ps1 -Type PowerShell â€“Force
        
        Publish-AzAutomationRunbook -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -AutomationAccountName user-automation-01 -Name ManageDynamicAddressRoutes
        ```

    * Create Webhook

        ```PowerShell
        New-AzAutomationWebhook -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -AutomationAccountName user-automation-01 -RunbookName ManageDynamicAddressRoutes -Name routetableupdate -IsEnabled $True -ExpiryTime "07/12/2022" -Force
        ```

        The output will include the URL of the enabled webhook. The webhook is only viewable at creation and cannot be retrieved afterwards. The output will look similar to below.

        ```text
        ResourceGroupName     : automation-01
        AutomationAccountName : user-automation-01
        Name                  : routetableupdate
        CreationTime          : 7/13/2021 8:33:28 PM +00:00
        Description           :
        ExpiryTime            : 7/12/2022 12:00:00 AM +00:00
        IsEnabled             : True
        LastInvokedTime       : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM +00:00
        LastModifiedTime      : 7/13/2021 8:33:28 PM +00:00
        Parameters            : {}
        RunbookName           : ManageDynamicAddressRoutes
        WebhookURI            : https://f5f015ed-f566-483d-c972-0c2c3ca2a296.webhook.eus2.azure-automation.net/webhooks?token=P1GSd4Tasf5i1VYaVkFQvG29QCjkA8AOHY%2bsVLZOFSA%3d
        HybridWorker          :
        ```
